# Face-Generator
Face Generator Using Nvidia's NN's. While training an GAN on a personal machine would've been preferred, current resources did not allow for that. So instead, I used the already created Nvidia GAN and slightly modified its generation and strung togegther the produced images to create a small clip of a changing face. The final result can be seen below.
